#4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
#There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

#Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

#Example 1:
#nums1 = [1, 3]
#nums2 = [2]

#The median is 2.0
#Example 2:
#nums1 = [1, 2]
#nums2 = [3, 4]

#The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
