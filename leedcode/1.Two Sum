Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


CODE:  python 3.0

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        dic = {}
        for i,each in enumerate(nums):
            if each not in dic:
                dic[each] = [i]
            else:
                dic[each].append(i)
        
        for each in nums:
            out = target - each
            if out in dic:
                if each != out:
                    return [dic[each][0],dic[out][0]]
                elif len(dic[out]) >= 2:
                    return [dic[out][0],dic[out][1]]
